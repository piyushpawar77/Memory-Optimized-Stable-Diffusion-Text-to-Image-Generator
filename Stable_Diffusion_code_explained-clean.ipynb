    "# 📚 Libraries Used in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses several important libraries to run and optimize **Stable Diffusion** in Google Colab.  \n",
    "Here’s what each one is used for in general, and how it is used in **my code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 1. `diffusers`\n",
    "Hugging Face’s library dedicated to diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.  \n",
    "It is used in the ML community for text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, and other generative tasks.  \n",
    "It provides ready-to-use pipelines and schedulers that simplify running large diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used for `StableDiffusionPipeline` to load and run Stable Diffusion.  \n",
    "- used for `EulerDiscreteScheduler` to optimize inference speed in Colab.  \n",
    "- This is the **core library running the model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. `transformers`\n",
    "Hugging Face’s library for natural language processing and multimodal tasks.  \n",
    "It is widely used for pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and CLIP, which handle text embeddings, classification, and more.  \n",
    "In diffusion workflows, it helps transform text prompts into embeddings the model can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used for the **CLIP text encoder**, which converts prompts into embeddings.  \n",
    "- even though not imported directly, `diffusers` relies on it internally.  \n",
    "- without this library, the model would not understand the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. `accelerate`\n",
    "Hugging Face’s library for managing hardware acceleration across CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs.  \n",
    "It is used for distributing models efficiently across devices and simplifying mixed setups (e.g., multiple GPUs).  \n",
    "It abstracts away complex device placement so that developers can focus on the model instead of CUDA details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used internally by `diffusers` to optimize execution on Colab’s GPU.  \n",
    "- ensures smooth model loading and inference without me handling CUDA directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. `torch` (PyTorch)\n",
    "A deep learning framework that powers most modern AI models.  \n",
    "It is used for defining neural networks, tensor computations, GPU acceleration, and training/inference of models.  \n",
    "Most generative AI models, including Stable Diffusion, are implemented in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used for GPU detection: `torch.cuda.is_available()`.  \n",
    "- used for memory management: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.  \n",
    "- used for reproducibility: `torch.manual_seed()`.  \n",
    "- used for faster inference: `torch.autocast()` (mixed precision).  \n",
    "- all Stable Diffusion model computations run on PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 5. `torchvision`\n",
    "An extension of PyTorch focused on computer vision.  \n",
    "It is used for loading image datasets, applying image transformations, and providing pre-trained vision models.  \n",
    "It often comes bundled with PyTorch in ML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used only as a dependency installed with PyTorch.  \n",
    "- not used directly in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 6. `gradio`\n",
    "A Python library for creating user interfaces for machine learning models.  \n",
    "It is used widely for building quick demos where users can interact with models through buttons, sliders, textboxes, or images.  \n",
    "This makes complex ML models accessible to non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used to build the Colab interface:\n",
    "  - buttons to load models and generate images  \n",
    "  - textboxes for prompts and negative prompts  \n",
    "  - sliders for steps, guidance, and resolution  \n",
    "  - image display for generated results  \n",
    "- used for `gr.Progress()` to show real-time progress during generation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 7. `safetensors`\n",
    "A specialized file format for storing model weights.  \n",
    "It is used because it loads models faster than `.bin` or `.pt` and avoids security risks from Python pickling.  \n",
    "This format is optimized for large diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my code:**\n",
    "- used for loading Stable Diffusion weights with `use_safetensors=True`.  \n",
    "- used to speed up model loading and save VRAM in Colab.  \n",
    "- ensures safe and efficient checkpoint handling.\n"

    "This class is a **wrapper around the Stable Diffusion pipeline** that makes it easy to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- load and optimize a model for Colab,\n",
    "- generate images from text prompts,\n",
    "- track real-time progress,\n",
    "- manage GPU memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines utilities from `diffusers`, `torch`, and `gradio` into one organized interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 `__init__`\n",
    "**Purpose:** Class initializer (constructor).  \n",
    "- Sets up the device (`cuda` if available, else CPU).  \n",
    "- Initializes placeholders for the pipeline (`self.pipe`) and progress tracking variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this code:**\n",
    "- `self.pipe = None` → pipeline not yet loaded.  \n",
    "- `self.device` → auto-detects GPU (important for Colab).  \n",
    "- `self.progress_callback` → stores a function to update progress in the UI.  \n",
    "- `self.start_time` + `self.total_steps` → used to estimate how long image generation will take.  \n",
    "- Prints which device is being used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 `progress_fn(self, step, timestep, latents)`\n",
    "**Purpose:** A callback function that tracks progress while the model generates images.  \n",
    "- Called every generation step by the diffusion pipeline.  \n",
    "- Calculates elapsed time, estimated remaining time, and % complete.  \n",
    "- Formats times nicely into seconds, minutes, or hours.  \n",
    "- Sends updates to the Gradio UI via `self.progress_callback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this code:**\n",
    "- Gives real-time feedback like:  \n",
    "  `\"🎨 Generating: 46.7% complete | ⏱️ Elapsed: 12.3s | ⏳ Remaining: 14.5s\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 `load_model(self, model_id=..., progress=...)`\n",
    "**Purpose:** Load the Stable Diffusion model with Colab optimizations.  \n",
    "- Clears old models from memory (to prevent VRAM leaks).  \n",
    "- Downloads the specified model from Hugging Face (`from_pretrained`).  \n",
    "- Configures precision (FP16 on GPU, FP32 on CPU).  \n",
    "- Disables the safety checker (saves VRAM).  \n",
    "- Switches scheduler to `EulerDiscreteScheduler` (fast & efficient).  \n",
    "- Enables optimizations: attention slicing, VAE slicing/tiling, CPU offload.  \n",
    "- Moves model to GPU/CPU.  \n",
    "- Returns a success or error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this code:**\n",
    "- Default model: `\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"` (fast & stable).  \n",
    "- Progress messages update in Gradio during each stage of loading.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 `generate_image(self, prompt, negative_prompt=\"\", ...)`\n",
    "**Purpose:** Generate an image from a text prompt.  \n",
    "- Validates input (keeps resolution ≤ 768px, steps ≤ 30).  \n",
    "- Sets up progress tracking (start time, total steps).  \n",
    "- Applies seed if specified (for reproducibility).  \n",
    "- Clears GPU memory before generation.  \n",
    "- Calls `self.pipe(...)` to run Stable Diffusion with the prompt.  \n",
    "- Uses `self.progress_fn` to update status every step.  \n",
    "- Collects the output image, clears cache again.  \n",
    "- Returns `(image, status_message)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this code:**\n",
    "- Default settings:  \n",
    "  - 15 steps,  \n",
    "  - 512x512 resolution,  \n",
    "  - guidance scale 7.5 (how strongly the image follows the prompt).  \n",
    "- Example message after success:  \n",
    "  `\"✅ Image generated successfully in 23.4s!\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 `get_memory_info(self)`\n",
    "**Purpose:** Report current GPU memory usage.  \n",
    "- Uses PyTorch APIs (`torch.cuda.memory_allocated`, `torch.cuda.memory_reserved`).  \n",
    "- Reports how much GPU memory is used, reserved, and the total available.  \n",
    "- If running on CPU, just returns `\"Running on CPU\"`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this code:**\n",
    "- Helpful for monitoring VRAM in Colab.  \n",
    "- Example: `\"GPU Memory - Used: 2.45GB | Reserved: 3.10GB | Total: 15.8GB\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🎛️ `create_interface()` – Building the Gradio UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "This function defines and returns my **Gradio interface**.  \n",
    "It provides a **web-based GUI** for loading models, entering prompts, tuning settings, and generating images.  \n",
    "I don’t interact directly with the class methods anymore — instead, I use buttons, sliders, and textboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What happens step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interface Setup**\n",
    "   - I use `gr.Blocks` to build a flexible UI layout.\n",
    "   - Title: `\"Fast Stable Diffusion Generator\"`.\n",
    "   - Theme: `gr.themes.Soft()` → makes the UI visually cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Header**\n",
    "   - Adds a Markdown title and description:\n",
    "     - `\"# ⚡ Fast Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image Generator\"`\n",
    "     - `\"Optimized for Google Colab with Real-time Progress Tracking\"`\n",

    "3. **🎨 Image Generation Tab**\n",
    "   - Split into **two main columns**:\n",
    "     - **Left Column (controls):**\n",
    "       - **Model loading:**\n",
    "         - Dropdown → select model version (`v1-5`, `2-1-base`, `v1-4`).\n",
    "         - Load button → calls `generator.load_model(...)`.\n",
    "         - Status textbox → shows loading results.\n",
    "       - **Prompt settings:**\n",
    "         - Prompt box (`✨ Prompt`) → main text input.\n",
    "         - Negative prompt box (`🚫 Negative Prompt`) → optional filter for bad outputs.\n",
    "       - **Generation parameters:**\n",
    "         - Slider: `Inference Steps` (8–30).\n",
    "         - Slider: `Guidance Scale` (3–15).\n",
    "         - Dropdowns: `Width` + `Height` (256–768).\n",
    "         - Seed: number input (default -1 for random).\n",
    "       - **Generate button**:\n",
    "         - `\"🎨 Generate Image\"` → runs `generator.generate_image(...)`.\n",
    "       - **Quick Presets**:\n",
    "         - Buttons for **Ultra Fast (8 steps)**, **Balanced (15 steps)**, **High Quality (25 steps)** → auto-adjust sliders.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Right Column (outputs):**\n",

    "     - `generate_btn.click(...)` → calls `generator.generate_image`.\n",
    "     - Preset buttons (`fast_btn`, `balanced_btn`, `quality_btn`) → set sliders automatically.\n",
    "     - `refresh_memory_btn.click(...)` → updates memory info.\n",
    "     - `interface.load(...)` → shows memory usage immediately on startup.\n",
